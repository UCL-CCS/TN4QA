# Contributing to TN4QA

The open source package TN4QA is designed to offer a convenient way to integrate tensor network methods into your quantum algorithm routines. There are several ways you can contribute to improve this package!

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute a new feature or fix a bug, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. Open a new issue in the repository [TN4QA](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/TN4QA) and provide a description of the change you will make.

2. Create a fork of the repository [TN4QA](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/TN4QA) in your own GitHub.

3. Checkout a new branch using the naming convention "issue_###_YourGitHubUsername"

3. Make changes in your branch. Please stick to the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style.

4. For any new functions or classes, include docstrings following the [Google format](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). From the top level of the repository you should be able to build the docs using the following

```
cd ./docs
make html
python3 -m http.server -d build/html 8080
```

so that the docs are accessible through http://localhost:8080

5. For bug fixes, include a new unit test that would catch the error you have fixed. For new features, include unit tests in the appropriate test file.

6. Open a pull request in the original repository.

7. In the pull request description, briefly outline the changes you've made and highlight where you've added any tests. Link to the issue you created.
