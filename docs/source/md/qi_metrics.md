# Tutorial: Quantum Information Metrics

Given a MatrixProductState (generally the output of a DMRG calculation) we can calculate orbital entropies and mutual information between orbitals. The functions to calculate these properties are in `tn4qa.qi_metrics`. Details on their use can be found in the module API.
